I am trying to create a CLI tool named solo-cli written in go (golang) that serves as a TUI for the service SOLO.ro which is an online accounting platform. I managed to register the most important API calls that happen in my normal use on the website. in the "docs/re" folder you can find *.curl files that represents the curl requests, the matching *.json files which are their responses (sometimes they are not JSONs) and a unique "login.cookie" which are the cookies received after the initial "login.curl" that responds with "login.json" but the response itself is useless as the cookies is all we need to keep once past login. the CLI tool should read the user/pass from a config.json that is created at launch (with empty user/pass in ~/.config/solo-cli path. if the credentials are missing or bad, respond with that telling the user then quit. this is the first step of the implementation
